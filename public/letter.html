Well to start, you’re kind, witty, cute, gentle, athletic (almost as much as me heh)... More specifically, you’re very open with yourself. You don’t try to look cool, you just be who you are. I think you have a charismatic sense of humor and you’re kind of quirky. You inspired me to find my faith again when I was at a big low in my life. Life is just better with you and you make me a better person. These are some of my serious reasons (I’m trying to make this not too cringe)… I have other reasons that are just dumb LOL like I still get so fucking excited every time your name pops up on my screen. But yeah, I hope you had a good birthday Hyoyo. You deserve the best.
